# Tutoring For Python

I started tutoring for Python as a part time job while pursuing my Masters degree. This repository includes interactions between me and my students with backdrop as Python.
So it will include code snippets on various concepts like Lists, Files, Dictionaries, Web API, Pandas library etc.
It will also include some hackerrank problem set, for example I came across a J.P. Morgan Chase Hackerrank Challenge and have uploaded my solution to it.
My tutees go through three exams in total in the entire semester of this course, which are mostly multiple choice questions, there are some code snippets and some practice exams that I generally create before their exams.
